## About
BxC is a cutting-edge synthetic turbulence algorithm, designed as an aiding tool in the study and understanding of turbulent phenomena. The generated synthetic fields boast an actual “look-and-feel” resemblance to turbulent fields, together with presenting the proper higher-order statistics.

In the context of synthetic models, BxC stands out for its alternative approach. The name stands for *magnetic field from multiplicative chaos*, turbulence-realted field of study that first inspired the foundations of the algorithm. The core idea behind the development of BxC is to have a general, versatile tool, not restricted to any specific application. Although it is primarily tuned to recreate plasma and astrophysical scenarios, its use can easily be extended to hydrodynamics applications as well. Such versatility practically translates in user-controlled parameters that allows for a full customization of the power spectrum, and user-controlled features such as structured background fields and anisotropy, which are characteristic of real physical scenarios.

## Using BxC
The development of BxC took and still takes a lot of time and effort. We kindly ask that **the first published peer-reviewed paper from applying BxC is done in co-authorship with at least one of the original authors**. Additionally, if you use BxC in a publication we kindly request that you cite the code paper.
