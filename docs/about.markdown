BxC is a cutting-edge synthetic turbulence algorithm, designed as an aiding tool in the study and understanding of turbulent phenomena. The generated synthetic fields boast an actual “look-and-feel” resemblance to turbulent fields, together with presenting the proper higher-order statistics.

Turbulence is a complex and ubiquitous phenomenon that plays a critical role in various scientific disciplines, from hydrodynamics to astrophysics. Its universal presence makes the study of turbulence essential for understanding the physical processes driving numerous phenomena. Traditional methods of simulating turbulence, such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), can be extremely computationally intensive. Synthetic turbulence models offer a valid and efficient aiding tool, allowing to reach unprecedented resolutions with minimal computational resources. Synthetic turbulence is crucial for advancing the analysis of turbulent flows, serving as bridge between theoretical studies, physics-based simulations, and observational data. 

In the context of synthetic models, BxC stands out for its alternative approach. The name stands for *magnetic field from multiplicative chaos*, turbulence-related field of study that first inspired the foundations of the algorithm. The core idea behind the development of BxC is to have a general, versatile tool, not restricted to any specific application. Although it is primarily tuned to recreate plasma and astrophysical scenarios, its use can easily be extended to hydrodynamics applications as well. Such versatility practically translates in user-controlled parameters that allows for a full customization of the power spectrum, and user-controlled features such as structured background fields and anisotropy, which are characteristic of real physical scenarios.
