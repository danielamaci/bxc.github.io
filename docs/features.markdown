BxC generates data cubes of turbulent magnetic fields, that are realistic both from a visual and statistical point of view. One of the main advantages of BxC lies in the many degrees of freedom users have in order to customize the generated fields. 

Through user-controlled parameters, BxC generates turbulent fields that have:

| **Hierarchically structured magnetic eddies and current sheets** |

| **Intermittency** | **Fully customizable power spectrum** |

| **Anisotropy** | **Background topologies** |

## Validation against DNS
The fields generated by BxC have been compared and validated against results from a DNS simulation. Here are some of the results in terms of statistical properties of the fields. For the full comparative analysis, we refer the readers to the published [paper](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.106.025307).
